lab-06-tcp-chat-server Lab Overview June 19,2017

* Write a paragraph about your project

My project entails some basic functionality to a local host chatroom... it includes group messages to every user, direct messages to other users in the chat, a user can change their username, troll others with multiple multiple repeated messages, as well as quitting the chatroom and notifying other users.

* Write docs on how to get the project running
To start the server, one must run the program from using node... to begin the chatroom, one simply needs to run node index.js to begin the program. This person is now hosting the chatroom...


* Write docs on how to connect to the server

to enter the chatroom, simply enter into the command command line ... "telnet localhost 3000", (this designated port for the chatroom) in another window of your bash/terminal.
